# Robotics sensor fusion with AI



## Text

### Summary
LUXEED Robotics B.V. is a Dutch AgTech startup on a mission to make farming healthier and more sustainable. Using lasers and AI, we target weeds with surgical precision; no herbicides, no compromise.

As demand for chemical-free crops grows worldwide, we’re building technology that helps farmers grow more on the same land while protecting soil, water, and ecosystems. Backed by national and international recognition, we’re now scaling our R&D to bring this impact to the field.

We’re looking for a Mechatronics Engineer to join our team on a contract basis and help bring our robotic system to the next level.

### Responsibilities

Enhance and maintain our EKF-based 3D tracking system, integrating IMU and depth data for robust sensor fusion.

Develop real-time control systems, including trajectory planning, synchronization, and calibration.

Build and validate mathematical models to map AI detections (camera/world frames) to precise targeting angles.

Collaborate with AI and hardware teams to integrate computer vision and tracking algorithms into robotic control.

Optimize perception modules for reliable depth estimation and real-time weed detection.

Implement robotic software in ROS2, Python, and C++.

Run experiments, analyze performance, and continuously improve system robustness.

### Qualifications

Bachelor’s or Master’s in Mechatronics, Robotics, Computer Science, or related field.

Strong foundation in computer vision, sensor fusion, and depth perception.

Hands-on experience with Kalman Filters, SLAM, and real-time tracking.

Proficiency in ROS2, Python, and C++.

Familiarity with embedded systems and real-time robotic control.

Bonus: experience with deep learning perception frameworks.

Strong problem-solving mindset and ability to thrive in a fast-paced R&D environment.

### Why Join Us?

Work at the intersection of robotics, AI, and sustainability.

Contribute to cutting-edge technology revolutionizing farming.

Collaborate with a passionate, international team.

Remote-first contract role, with flexibility and opportunities for long-term collaboration.

### How to Apply:

### Computer Vision Expert for Visual-Based Navigation (VBN) Systems for UAVs

We are seeking a highly skilled and experienced freelance computer vision expert to collaborate on an innovative project aimed at developing aVisual-Based Navigation (VBN) system for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), specifically drones (quadcopters and fixed-wing). This project addresses a critical challenge: enabling UAVs to navigate dynamically in low-visibility conditions—such as fog, clouds, smoke, and other environmental obstacles—where existing VBN systems falter due to their lack of adaptability. We are not looking for beginners or freelancers who rely solely on open-source code from platforms like GitHub. Instead, we need a seasoned professional with a proven track record in visual navigation for UAVs, capable of providing expert guidance to me, a C++ software developer, in designing, implementing, and optimizing advanced algorithms for real-world deployment.

Project Overview
The current challenge is clear: existing Visual-Based Navigation Systems (VBNs) struggle in low-visibility conditions and lack the adaptability required for dynamic, real-world environments. This limitation is particularly critical for UAVs, such as drones , which may encounter GPS jamming.

To address this, we aim to develop a multi-modal, low-visibility navigation system that integrates Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) imaging and synthetic data augmentation to enhance robustness and resilience. This system will operate independently of GPS, relying solely on cameras and advanced algorithms, making it a standalone, cutting-edge solution for autonomous navigation. The project is trendy and underexplored, offering a unique opportunity to tackle a challenging problem with real-world applications.

Role Responsibilities
As a freelance expert, you will:
- Guide Algorithm Development: Provide technical expertise to me, a C++ software developer, in designing, implementing, and enhancing algorithms, including selecting the best baseline models
- Collaborate on Technical Challenges: Offer insights into integrating LWIR and visible-spectrum data, handling low-visibility conditions, and ensuring real-time performance on the Nvidia Jetson AGX Orin.
- Support Testing and Validation: Assist in validating the system on the quadcopter (Phase 1) and later on fixed-wing drones (Phase 2)

-Participate in Meetings: Collaborate with me online (and potentially with teammates) to discuss progress, troubleshoot issues, and refine the approach.

Freelancer Requirements
We are seeking a candidate with the following qualifications:

Proven Expertise:
Extensive experience in visual-based navigation (VBN) for UAVs (quadcopters and/or fixed-wing drones), particularly in low-visibility or GPS-denied environments.

A strong portfolio of past projects demonstrating tangible contributions to computer vision and UAV navigation—not just adaptations of open-source code.

Experience with real-time processing on embedded platforms like the Nvidia Jetson AGX Orin, including hardware constraints (size, power, capability).

Familiarity with C++ for algorithm implementation and integration with UAV systems is a plus.

Experience Level:
Senior-level expertise with hands-on experience developing custom algorithms for real-world UAV applications, not simulations or video inputs alone.
Ability to innovate and provide original solutions beyond open-source implementations.

Collaboration Skills:

Capability to guide a C++ software developer in technical decision-making, baseline selection, and algorithm enhancement through online meetings.

Note: This role is not suitable for beginners or freelancers lacking proven experience in visual navigation. We require evidence of your contributions to similar projects and reject reliance on unmodified open-source code from platforms like GitHub.
